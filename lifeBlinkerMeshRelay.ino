////This version of the Life-Blinker is hardware+software, and uses 2 or more Life Blinkers.
//The lifeBlinkerMeshRelay uses a mesh network to extend signaling over multiple nodes,
//for up to a mile (range tests and max node count pending).
//This variant can be used to communicate alerts, or send Morse code wirelessly.
//Adding a momentary switch may be desirable for your use case.

////Code in progress, pending mesh mode debugging.
//eta Q3-Q4 2024, file a bug report against this .ino if you want to see it sooner!
//I will otherwise prioritize other features based on various constraints. -JB
