////This version of the Life-Blinker is hardware+software
//Building on two pairs of lifeBlinkerGyro, two opponents punch eachothers lights out, from a distance!

////How it works:
//Keep those dukes up!  If you lower one hand, the opponents punch will do double damage.
//If you lower both hands, the opponnents punch does even more damage.
//If you trade blows at the same time, the harder hitter will deal more damage to the slower one
//based off the difference between the higher and lower speed (like parrying).
//Juke your opponents with fake hits they want to parry and strike them with their guard down!

////Code in progress, pending results of gyro hardware test
//ic2 based gryo vs
//analog gyro
//eta Q1-Q2 2024, file a bug report against this .ino if you want to see it sooner!
//I will otherwise prioritize other features based on various constraints. -JB
