---INTRO---

The Life Blinker began as a bike-blinker safety device made by J. Bourdlaies in response to a massive increase in bicyclists involved in accidents and fatalities worldwide.  Drivers are more distracted than ever, so markers and signals offer an important countermeasure.  Due to the arduino core, it is easy for anyone to build the Life Blinker.  Details, product and DIY videos are available on links below.

bikeBlinker, the Life Blinker classic, is a $11USD DIY build with the single largest as the $2-3USD globally available Arduino D1 Mini dev-board (clones work fine, too).  A directly attached 3-position switch selects left, right, and coast mode.  No switch is required for pedestrians and joggers, who can wear it with the lights in coast mode (as might ice-climbers).

---EXPANSIONS VARIANTS AND OPTIONS---

Life Blinker Duo expands on the classic design.  You can use the hardware as-is from the bike-blinker-original, with or without the original 3-position switch (leave in coast mode, tho).  The Duo Remote will send left/right/coast state from your handlebars without the need for any wiring added in between.

Enhancements are underway, as code-only or sensors-added. This same design can find many ther uses include remote assistance, doorbells for the hearing impaired, and more†.  I'm even making a shadow boxing game‡ with two pairs of the Life-Blinker-Gyro edition, which requires only a code upload to change between being a safey device and a punchout party product!

†For elder-care, in-home nurse light, and hearing-impaired doorbell use LifeBlinkerHome.ino for the LEDs, and LifeBlinkerHomeRemote.ino together.  Be sure to update the wifi access details (ad hoc mode is possible, but your residential wifi provided an excellent backbone for the remote).

‡Light's OUT is a shadow boxing game.  All four devices will need to be LifeBlinkerGyro builds.  WIP.

A communication relay using a wireless mesh will be shared in lifeBlinkerMeshRelay. Put your signal mirrors way, and get ready to cut the strings off those coke cans.
