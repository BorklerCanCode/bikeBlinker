The Life Blinker began as a bike-blinker safety device made by J. Bourdlaies in response to a massive increase in bicylcists involved in accidents and fatalities worldwide.  Drivers are more distracted than ever, so markers and signals seem like an important countermeasure.  Thanks to arduino, it is easy for anyone to build the Life Blinker.  Details, product and DIY videos are available on links below.

Enhancements are underway, as code-only or sensors-added. This same design can find many ther uses include remote assistance, doorbells for the hearing impaired, and more.  I'm even making a shadow boxing game with two pairs of the Life-Blinker-Gyro edition, which requires only a code upload to change between being a safey device and a punchout party product!
